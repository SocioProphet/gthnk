History of gthnk
================

I began documenting my work-related thoughts in a *work journal* circa 2006.  Initially, I used Open Office templates.  I chose to separate journal entries with a timestamp because I could type it pretty quickly on a numeric keypad.  I iterated through quite a few methods for keeping a chronological sequence of entries until I ended up with **gthnk**.

This work was inspired by DevonThink, which I really tried to use.  For me, I needed a less opaque container for my information.  I wanted my text files to stay text files, because my concern was that years or decades down the road, I would not be able to access text files stored in a DevonThink filesystem container.

This work was also inspired by Vernor Vinge's *Marooned in Realtime*, which featured a companion-like computer called "Greenthink".  This computer presented an interface that was hight customized to the person who trained and used their Greenthink system.
