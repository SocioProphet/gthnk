Contributing
============

Gthnk welcomes contributions from the community.
The most important theme Gthnk needs help with is *communication*.
Here are examples of some ways you can help:

- Help field questions from the community
- Extend and clarify the documentation
- Implement your favorite feature
- Fix a bug in the code
- improve code quality, coverage, and comments

Help field questions from the community
---------------------------------------

So you've become a Gthnk power user and now you know enough to fix other peoples' Gthnk problems.
Fantastic!
Please join our chatroom at http://chat.gthnk.com and just hang out to help answer questions from the community.
People will occasionally come by to ask questions and you can help immensely by answering some of them.

Implement your favorite feature
-------------------------------

If you know a feature you'd like to code in order to help with Gthnk, then the easiest way to help is by submitting a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_ to Gthnk on GitHub.
From your perspective, there is no barrier preventing you from contributing to Gthnk today.

Help with the documentation
---------------------------

Project documentation is one of the most important aspects of an open source project.
You can help immensely by editing the current documentation for clarity.
You can find the documentation in the `Gthnk repository <https://github.com/iandennismiller/gthnk/>`_, which you can modify by submitting a pull request.

Help with an existing issue
---------------------------

Another way you can contribute is by working directly upon issues that have been submitted by the community using the `Issue Tracker <http://issues.gthnk.com>`_.
This is more advanced than simply implementing a new feature, because the issue may specify acceptance criteria.
It is recommended that you coordinate with project members before working on an issue.
The easiest way to contact the team is through the `Issue Tracker <http://issues.gthnk.com>`_ itself, because each issue has a comment thread associated with it.
